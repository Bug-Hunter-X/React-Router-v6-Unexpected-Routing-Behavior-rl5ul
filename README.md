# React Router v6 Unexpected Routing Behavior Bug Report

This repository demonstrates a bug encountered when using React Router v6.  The issue involves unexpected routing behavior where routes fail to match correctly, leading to incorrect page rendering or blank screens. This often manifests with nested routes or intricate route configurations.

## Bug Description

Routes defined using `Routes` and `Route` components in React Router v6 are not matching as expected.  This may involve mismatched paths, incorrect nesting, or other configuration errors, leading to unpredictable navigation within the application.

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install` to install the necessary dependencies.
3. Run `npm start` to start the development server.
4. Navigate to different routes to observe the unexpected behavior.

## Expected Behavior

The application should accurately match and render the components associated with each defined route.

## Actual Behavior

The application renders incorrect pages or blank screens, indicating improper route matching.

## Solution

The solution involves carefully reviewing and correcting route definitions, addressing potential issues such as:
- Incorrect path specifications
- Missing or incorrect route nesting
- Conflicts between route definitions
- Incorrect usage of `useLocation` or other navigation hooks
